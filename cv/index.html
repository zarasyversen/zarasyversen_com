	<div class="head-title"><h2>About Zara</h2></div>
    <p>I am a Swedish girl who moved to Brighton to study for a web design diploma about a year ago and ended up falling in love with the place!</p>
    <p>I have been coding for 8 years, creating and learning simply because I enjoy it. After my diploma finished, I started to attend <a href="http://www.codebar.io" target="_blank">Codebar</a>, an amazing weekly event where I have met lovely, inspiring people that made me want to pursue a career in web.</p>

	<div class="head-title"><h2>Skills</h2></div>
	<p>I am confident with XHTML, HTML5 and very keen about clean &amp; validated code. One of my favorite parts is the styling with CSS and CSS3 features. Recently started learning about CSS preprocessors and I am excited about using SASS in my next web project. JavaScript has always been there in the background but jQuery has been a better friend to me. PHP has crossed my path many times, starting with a small mail-script and template building in WordPress to building my own CMS (Content Management System) with MySQL at Hove College. I was the second student ever to complete it! </p>

    <p>I have used Adobe Creative Suite for over 10 years, being more than comfortable in using Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator for different design projects. For web design, I started with Dreamweaver but now moved on to using the text editor Sublime instead, with Cyberduck (Live editing is a game-changer) and I learned how to manage projects with Git (but my <a href="https://github.com/zarasyversen" target="_blank">Github profile</a> is still quite empty). With Ruby, I have learned how to use the command prompt (which is really cool!) and build my own blog. I have also used <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/zarasyver" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> and <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/" target="_blank">Code School</a> as a resource to learn and practice code.</p>
    <div class="head-title"><h2>What I am up to</h2></div>
    <h3>Web Projects</h3>
    <p>Please have a look at my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zarasyversen.com">website</a> for some visual examples. You can also find small projects on my <a href="http://codepen.io/madebyzara/" target="_blank">Codepen</a>!</p>
    <h3>#JavaScript30 </h3>
    <p>Signed up for Wes Bos challenge, <a href="https://javascript30.com/" target="_blank">JavaScript30</a>, a 30 day coding challenge to improve your JavaScript - and I have been learning loads! </p>
    <h3>Cleaning older code</h3>
    <p>Some of my websites can be improved in many ways, as my knowledge has developed greatly since they were originally built. Currently working on updating this to make the websites even better!</p>
    <h3>Project Management</h3>
    <p>During my diploma at Hove College, our final assignment was to complete a web project. It started with a client brief with specifications, moving on to discussing legislation and web standards, accessibility, usability and target audience before actual development started. Throughout the project, the issues and changes during development was examined and evaluated, following every step in the process from content and design to client-side and server-side script. This was a great project where self-evaluation and development commentary helped understand and advance my knowledge with web design. Full documentation is available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByEWiv7jAbsYTk1OZ2s0TmpuUkk/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
    <h3>Digital marketing</h3>
